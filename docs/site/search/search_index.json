It is container-native and fits as your de-facto service mesh in your Kubernetes cluster. It supports the latest Service Mesh Interface specification SMI that facilitates integration with pre-existing solutions. Moreover, Maesh is opt-in by default, which means that your existing services are unaffected until you decide to add them to the mesh. Non-Invasive Service Mesh \u00b6 Maesh does not use any sidecar container but handles routing through proxy endpoints running on each node. The mesh controller runs in a dedicated pod and handles all the configuration parsing and deployment to the proxy nodes. Maesh supports multiple configuration options: annotations on user service objects, and SMI objects. Not using sidecars means that Maesh does not modify your kubernetes objects, and does not modify your traffic without your knowledge. Using the Maesh endpoints is all that is required. Prerequisites \u00b6 To run this app, you require the following: Kubernetes 1.11+ CoreDNS installed as Cluster DNS Provider (versions 1.3+ supported) Helm v2 with a working tiller service account","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#maesh-simpler-service-mesh","text":"Maesh is a simple, yet full-featured service mesh.

The static configuration is configured when the maesh service mesh is installed, and is configured via the values.yaml file in the helm install. Static configuration \u00b6 The maesh image version can be manually defined if needed, as can the version for the Traefik CE mesh nodes. Debug logging can be globally enabled. The default mesh node can be configured. If this is not set, the default mode will be HTTP. This means that new mesh services that are not specified will default to operate in HTTP mode. Tracing can be enabled. Service Mesh Interface (SMI) mode can be enabled. This configures maesh to run in SMI mode, where access and routes are explicitly enabled. Note: By default, all routes and access is denied. Please see the SMI Specification for more information Dynamic configuration \u00b6 Traffic type \u00b6 Annotations on services are the main way to configure maesh behavior. The service mode can be enabled by using the following annotation: maesh.containo.us/traffic-type: \"http\" This annotation can be set to either http or tcp , and will specify the mode for that service operation. If this annotation is not present, the mesh service will operate in the default mode specified in the static configuration. Retry \u00b6 Retries can be enabled by using the following annotation: maesh.containo.us/retry-attempts: \"2\" This annotation sets the number of retry attempts that maesh will make if a network error occurrs. Please note that this value is a string, and needs to be quoted. Circuit breaker \u00b6 Circuit breaker can be enabled by using the following annotation: maesh.containo.us/circuit-breaker-expression: \"Expression\" This annotation sets the expression for circuit breaking. The circuit breaker protects your system from stacking requests to unhealthy services (resulting in cascading failures). When your system is healthy, the circuit is close (normal operations). When your system becomes unhealthy, the circuit becomes open and the requests are no longer forwarded (but handled by a fallback mechanism).
